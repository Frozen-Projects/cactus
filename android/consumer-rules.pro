# Add consumer ProGuard rules here for libraries that use this library.
# These rules will be applied to the consuming app.
# It is generally recommended NOT to obfuscate or remove public API classes and methods
# from your library, as consumers rely on them.
# Example:
# -keep class com.cactus.android.LlamaContext { *; }
# -keep class com.cactus.android.** { *; } # Keep everything in the package
