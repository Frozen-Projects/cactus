# Cactus React Native Chat Example (Expo)

A simple chat application built with React Native and Expo, demonstrating how to use the Cactus framework for on-device conversational AI.

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your physical device (iOS or Android)
    *   *Alternatively, setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for simulators.* 

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already) or navigate to this example directory (`examples/react-chat`).

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server & run the app:**

    *   **For Android (Emulator/Device):**
        ```bash
        npm run android
        # or
        yarn android
        ```
    *   **For iOS (Simulator/Device):**
        ```bash
        npm run ios
        # or
        yarn ios
        ```
    *   **Alternatively (using Expo Go on device):**
        Run `npx expo start`, then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.

## Usage

Interact with the chat interface. Type messages and see how the Cactus framework processes input and generates responses.

## Copy & Deploy

This example is designed to be a straightforward starting point. Feel free to copy, modify, and deploy this code for your own projects using Expo's build services or by ejecting.
